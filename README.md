### Problem

Reading is everything. But reading a page is slow.

Reading phrases that are 1 cm away from each other hurts focus and messes up peripheral vision. This makes reading slower.

Conventionally we trace with our fingers or with bookmarks to helps us with this - but there’s no online .epub reading tool with this tracing integrated.

### Solution

I’m building a super simple reading platform that hides all text following the current phrase being read - tracing the reading pace and allowing for focus on each phrase one touch at a time.

Users will be able to upload .epub files, store them in a library - and read them in an improved reader with tracing.

### Market

All .epub Readers in the world.

### Moonshot

If this proves to be useful could convert into the modern library and reader tool.

- Tracing
- Highlighting
- AI voice reader
- Notecard taker (highlight=notecard, when you finish book comprehensive look at all notecards and decide to ditch or not, SICK)
